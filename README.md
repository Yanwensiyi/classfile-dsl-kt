# classfile-dsl-kt
A DSL implementation for classfile api released in JDK 24.

**Note: this project is in very early stage and just provide a very simple DSL support**
**, and I don't want to write doc at all. Also, you still need to know how to use**
**official classfile api, and jvm bytecode design, or you will be confused when you need something**
**more advanced. Also this repo maybe archived any time if I don't want to maintain it anymore.**

If you have any issue you can just post it, but I seldom use github.
Maybe it'll be faster for you to fix it yourself lol :)
